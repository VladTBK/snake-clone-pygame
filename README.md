### Pygame Snake Clone
This project is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using Pygame. The primary objectives were to further work and have fun with the PyGame library and gaining a better understanding of object-oriented programming by utilizing classes within other classes.

##### Game Overview

The game loop features a snake object composed of smaller parts (its body) that moves continuously based on user input. 
The direction is controlled by pressing the WASD keys. Additionally, a point object spawns randomly at the beginning and every time it collides with the snake head, increasing the snake's length.
The game is over when the snake either "bites" itself or collides with the screen borders, showing the final score in the CLI.
